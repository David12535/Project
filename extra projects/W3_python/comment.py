#Comments can be used to explain Python code,For Example:.
#I created a variable named name to which I gave the value batoni daviti, and I printed it out on the screen through the following print
# name="batoni daviti"
# print(name)
#Comments can be used to make the code more readable,For Example:
#here are my homework,create a rectangle.
from turtle import*
width(2)
color("green")
forward(200)
left(90)
forward(250)
left(90)
forward(200)
left(90)
forward(250)
#Comments can be used to prevent execution when testing code.
# Or you don't need some code anymore and you don't want to delete it, you can comment
#print(2g1jja")
name="dato"
print(name)
# print('name)
